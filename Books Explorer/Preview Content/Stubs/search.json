        "description": "Don’t miss the second installment of Gabra Zackman’s scorching new series. “Stop the wedding!” No bride wants to hear those words, least of all Susannah “Legs” Carter, one of the Bod Squad’s best agents. But when her colleague Jackson bursts in with news that her presumed-dead father may still be alive—and possibly a double agent—the vows are on hold and the Bod Squad hits the road. Jackson wants to help, but he’s a little distracted by Cajun cutie Lisa Bee, his closest coworker. They’ve always been friends, but there’s nothing like a little overseas danger to set sparks flying! As the two work to track a criminal mastermind, will they swap undercover work for under-the-covers play?",

There is no one to meet them, but they are just in time to witness the brutal kidnap of Morgan the Wonderful Wandering Wohtt right from the path to Nitty Grittys front door, where Jenny and Atta had landed. When Nitty returns, she is shocked to hear about Morgans ill fate, but reveals that there are more tragedies on the surface of the planet; children have been disappearing from locked and barred homes and in various places right out from under their parents noses. She also discovers that the powerful alien Chrystal, an irreplaceable part of the Chrystal Gate, is also missing. There is no way, now, for Jenny and Atta to return home. With the help of the gallant Behrrn the Remember, a carved stoned pirate, a parrot named Marvin, a lost boy named Harrell (Rell to his friends) and a Molly Kahdel, an experienced guide, Jennifer and Atta join a group one of the groups dedicated to finding the lost children, Morgan the Wohtt, and the Chrystal necessary for their way back home. While with this company, she saves a toddler from falling into a VERY VERY VERY DEEP HOLE, only to fall into it herself. At the bottom, she realizes she has become invisible, unable to feel anything, or even to call for help. She floats to the surface, but is still unable to be seen, to be felt, or even to communicate in any way. Lonely and lost, she floats into one of several misty tunnels which try their hardest to trap her there",

        "description": "The hard years on the Amber Road had changed Photinus the Greek. He had won a fortune and lost an eye and married various wives and become a God. His cousin Philebus had played the game of the pea and the three cups; now, reluctantly, Photinus - Votan - set off to retrieve the Deed of Monopoly to all the Gold of Ireland. Sequel to the remarkable VOTAN, NOT FOR ALL THE GOLD IN IRELAND continues the adventures of John James' reluctant hero Photinus. One of the forgotten classics of fantasy, the duology is ripe for rediscovery. Fans include Neil Gaiman, who has provided a new introduction to the Fantasy Masterwork collection.",

        "description": "This study provides a historical analysis of Freudenthal’s didactic ideas and his didactic career. It is partly biographical, but also contributes to the historiography of mathematics education and addresses closely related questions such as: what is mathematics and where does it start? Which role does mathematics play in society and what influence does it have on the prevailing views concerning its accompanying didactics?. Hans Freudenthal (1905–1990), professor in mathematics, scientist, literator, but above all mathematics-educator, was inextricably linked to the changes which took place in mathematics education and didactics during the second half of the last century. His diversity as a scientist and his inexhaustible efforts to establish the didactics of mathematics as a seriously pursued science, made Freudenthal's influence in this area considerable. He foresaw an essential, practical role for mathematics in everyone’s life, encouraging students to discover and create mathematics themselves, instead of imposing a ready-made mathematical system. The theory of mathematics education thus developed in the Netherlands would gain world fame in the following decades. Today, in the light of the discussions about mathematics education, in which the call for `genuine’ mathematics instead of the so-called 'kindergarten'-mathematics can be heard, Freudenthal's approach seems to be passé. However, the outcome of this study (which is mainly based on documents from Freudenthal’s vast personal archive) shows a more refined picture. The direct identification of 'kindergarten'-mathematics with Freudenthal’s view on mathematics education is not justified. 'Realistic mathematics' as advocated by Freudenthal includes more than just a practical introductory and should, among other things, always aim at teaching 'genuine' mathematics in the end.",

What the Bible Is All About realizes her dream, and that book has become an essential companion for students of the Bible for more than 50 years. What the Bible Is All About for Moms is the second devotional based on Dr. Mears’ classic study guide. These 66 readings, one for each book of the Bible, will bring God’s Word into the homes and hearts of moms of all ages. Each chapter includes mom-specific excerpts from Henrietta’s original text, suggested Scripture reading for daily or weekly study, a devotional reading to connect the day’s verses to the everyday lives of mothers, a few ideas about applying God’s Word to the reader’s life and a suggested thought or question for further reflection. Moms are in the Bible from beginning to end, and now the Bible can be in the hearts and minds of moms!",

But not long ago, she was trying to survive the many perils of the Teen Age . . . The Rumor Mill: The more a rumor is spread, the farther it gets from the truth. It’s like a giant taffy pull. The Disgusting Business of Falling in Love: I’ve never known something to be so gleefully wonderful and soul-crushingly exhausting. The Twitter-Sphere: If the Internet is starting to crush your soul . . . close the laptop! Bears: Self-explanatory. Thankfully, she made it through! And although memories of her struggles, woes, and foibles stick around (as Soul Shrapnel, if you will), they look a little different today, thanks to The Amazing Goggles of Hindsight. So, in All I Know Now, Carrie shares, well, exactly that—heartfelt advice and hopeful thoughts on growing up. She just did it herself. She has the stuffed animals to prove it!",

This engaging summary presents an analysis of All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque, the world famous novel in which he paints a vivid portrait of the horrors of war, inspired by his own experience in the First World War.

The novel made him an enemy of the Nazis, who burnt many of his books during the Second World War. Since then, however, the novel has been adapted into an Oscar-winning movie starring Lew Ayres.

Yuri Elkaim's The All-Day Fat-Burning Diet provides the solution with his 5-Day Calorie Cycling Formula that sets your metabolism to lose up to 5 pounds a week. This plan eliminates the causes of weight gain and pushes the reset button on your fat-burning capacity. No combination of calorie cutting, exercising, or restrictive dieting will help you look and feel great unless you set your body to burn fat and lose weight all day, all night, when you're not eating or working out--24/7. In The All-Day Fat-Burning Diet, Elkaim reveals rarely discussed \"fat triggers\" along with an easy and innovative way to double weight loss in just 3 weeks. Based on a powerhouse blend of nutritional know-how, fitness experience, and solid science, Elkaim's four-pronged approach features (1) strategically cycling calories and carbohydrates; (2) eating \"clean and lean\" foods that reduce \"fat triggers\" in the body; (3) exercising more intelligently; and (4) improving the body's ability to repair and avoid burnout. This proven program will reset your body to your desired factory settings and supercharge your metabolism to burn fat on autopilot--no matter age, fitness level, or health status.",

She’s moved to Milwaukee for an entry-level corporate job that, grueling as it may be, is the key that unlocks every door: she can pick up the tab at dinner with her new friend Tig, get her college buddy Thom hired alongside her, and send money to her parents back in India. She begins dating women—soon developing a burning crush on Marina, a beguiling and beautiful dancer who always seems just out of reach. But before long, trouble arrives. Painful secrets rear their heads; jobs go off the rails; evictions loom. Sneha struggles to be truly close and open with anybody, even as her friendships deepen, even as she throws herself headlong into a dizzying romance with Marina. It’s then that Tig begins to draw up a radical solution to their problems, hoping to save them all. A beautiful and capacious novel rendered in singular, unforgettable prose, All This Could Be Different is a wise, tender, and riveting group portrait of young people forging love and community amidst struggle, and a moving story of one immigrant’s journey to make her home in the world.",

With a hit single under his Texas-sized belt buckle and a sold-out concert tour underway, his childhood dreams of making it big are finally coming true. But there’s one thing missing—a promise to his dying mother that he’d find it—him—when the time was right. With a little luck, he won’t have to wait too long . . . Lucky Ramirez is a hunky boy toy who dances at The Broom Closet, one of West Hollywood’s hottest gay bars. He loves what he does, and he’s good at it—almost as good as he is at playing dumb when he spots Michelin Moses at the bar. What happens next is off the charts—and keeps Michelin coming back for more. He’s just not sure it’s the right move for his career. But if Lucky gets his way, Michelin will get Lucky—and no matter how the media spins it, neither of them will be faking it . . .

        "description": "John Hodgman—bestselling author, The Daily Show's \"Resident Expert,\" minor television celebrity, and deranged millionaire—brings us the third and final installment in his trilogy of Complete World Knowledge. In 2005, Dutton published The Areas of My Expertise, a handy little book of Complete World Knowledge, marked by the distinction that all of the fascinating trivia and amazing true facts were completely made up by its author, John Hodgman. At the time, Hodgman was merely a former literary agent and occasional scribbler of fake trivia. In short: a nobody. But during an interview on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, an incredible transformation occurred. He became a famous minor television personality. You may ask: During his whirlwind tornado ride through the high ether of minor fame and outrageous fortune, did John Hodgman forget how to write books of fake trivia? The answer is: Yes. Briefly. But soon, he remembered! And so he returned, crashing his Kansas farmhouse down upon the wicked witch of ignorance with More Information Than You Require, a New York Times bestseller containing even more mesmerizing and essential fake trivia, including seven hundred mole-man names (and their occupations). And now, John Hodgman completes his vision with That Is All, the last book in a trilogy of Complete World Knowledge. Like its predecessors, That Is All compiles incredibly handy made-up facts into brief articles, overlong lists, and beguiling narratives on new and familiar themes. It picks up exactly where More Information left off—specifically, at page 596—and finally completes COMPLETE WORLD KNOWLEDGE. Look out for John Hodgman's latest book, Vacationland, available from Viking in Fall 2017.",

Yet the gravity of their deception doesn’t become clear to the good father until Enda shares the full tale of her suffering, finally confiding “the all of it.” Jeannette Haien’s exquisite, awardwinning first novel is a deceptively simple story that resonates with the power of a modern-day myth—an unforgettable narrative of transgression, empathy, and, ultimately, absolution.",

Two weeks after telling him she wanted a divorce, he was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. Four months later, at the age of forty-four, he died. In All of This, Woolf chronicles the months before her husband’s death—and her rebirth after he was gone. With rigorous honesty and incredible awareness, she reflects on the end of her marriage: how her husband’s illness finally gave her the space to make peace with his humanity and her own. Stunning, compelling, and brilliantly nuanced, All of This is one woman’s story of embracing the complexities of grief without shame—as a mother, a widow, and a sexual being—and emerging on the other side of a relationship with gratitude and relief.",

        "description": "***A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER*** A New York Times Book Review “Editors’ Choice” Entertainment Weekly — Thriller Round-Up The Wall Street Journal — 5 Killer Books Hollywood Reporter — Hot Summer Books…16 Must Reads “This thriller’s all of your fave page-turners (think: Luckiest Girl Alive, The Girl on the Train, Gone Girl) rolled into one.” —TheSkimm “Both [Gillian] Flynn’s and Miranda’s main characters also reclaim the right of female characters to be more than victim or femme fatale… All the Missing Girls is set to become one of the best books of 2016.” —Los Angeles Review of Books “Extremely interesting…a novel that will probably be called Hitchcockian.” —The New York Times Book Review “Are you paying attention? You’ll need to be; this thriller will test your brain with its reverse chronological structure, and it’s a page-turner to boot.” —Elle Like the spellbinding psychological suspense in The Girl on the Train and Luckiest Girl Alive, Megan Miranda’s novel is a nail-biting, breathtaking story about the disappearances of two young women—a decade apart—told in reverse. It’s been ten years since Nicolette Farrell left her rural hometown after her best friend, Corinne, disappeared from Cooley Ridge without a trace. Back again to tie up loose ends and care for her ailing father, Nic is soon plunged into a shocking drama that reawakens Corinne’s case and breaks open old wounds long since stitched. The decade-old investigation focused on Nic, her brother Daniel, boyfriend Tyler, and Corinne’s boyfriend Jackson. Since then, only Nic has left Cooley Ridge. Daniel and his wife, Laura, are expecting a baby; Jackson works at the town bar; and Tyler is dating Annaleise Carter, Nic’s younger neighbor and the group’s alibi the night Corinne disappeared. Then, within days of Nic’s return, Annaleise goes missing. Told backwards—Day 15 to Day 1—from the time Annaleise goes missing, Nic works to unravel the truth about her younger neighbor’s disappearance, revealing shocking truths about her friends, her family, and what really happened to Corinne that night ten years ago. Like nothing you’ve ever read before, All the Missing Girls delivers in all the right ways. With twists and turns that lead down dark alleys and dead ends, you may think you’re walking a familiar path, but then Megan Miranda turns it all upside down and inside out and leaves us wondering just how far we would be willing to go to protect those we love.",

Maren Yearly is a young woman who wants the same things we all do. She wants to be someone people admire and respect. She wants to be loved. But her secret, shameful needs have forced her into exile. She hates herself for the bad thing she does, for what it's done to her family and her sense of identity, for how it dictates her place in the world and how people see her--how they judge her. She didn't choose to be this way. Because Maren Yearly doesn't just break hearts, she devours them. Ever since her mother found Penny Wilson's eardrum in her mouth when Maren was just two years old, she knew life would never be normal for either of them. Love may come in many shapes and sizes, but for Maren, it always ends the same--with her hiding the evidence and her mother packing up the car. But when her mother abandons her the day after her sixteenth birthday, Maren goes looking for the father she has never known, and finds much more than she bargained for along the way. Faced with a world of fellow eaters, potential enemies, and the prospect of love, Maren realizes she isn't only looking for her father, she's looking for herself.",

Discover this poignant, timely, and emotionally stirring picture book, an ode to black and brown children everywhere that is full of hope, assurance, and love.Tami Charles pens a poetic, lyrical text that is part love letter, part anthem, assuring readers that they always have, and always will, matter. This powerful, rhythmic lullaby reassures readers that their matter and their worth is never diminished, no matter the circumstance: through the joy and wonder of their first steps and first laughter, through the hardship of adolescent struggles and the pain and heartbreak of current events, they always have, and always will, matter. Accompanied by illustrations by renowned artist Bryan Collier, a four-time Caldecott Honor recipient and a nine-time Coretta Scott King Award winner or honoree, All Because You Matter empowers readers with pride, joy, and comfort, reminding them of their roots and strengthening them for the days to come.Lyrical, personal, and full of love, All Because You Matter is for the picture book audience what The Hate U Give was for YA and Ghost Boys was for middle grade: a conversation starter, a community touchstone, and a deep affirmation of worth for the young readers who need it most.",

Tania de Batz is most herself with a sword in her hand. Everyone thinks her near-constant dizziness makes her weak, nothing but “a sick girl.” But Tania wants to be strong, independent, a fencer like her father—a former Musketeer and her greatest champion. Then Papa is brutally, mysteriously murdered. His dying wish? For Tania to attend finishing school. But L’Académie des Mariées, Tania realizes, is no finishing school. It’s a secret training ground for new Musketeers: women who are socialites on the surface, but strap daggers under their skirts, seduce men into giving up dangerous secrets, and protect France from downfall. And they don’t shy away from a sword fight. With her newfound sisters at her side, Tania feels that she has a purpose, that she belongs. But then she meets Étienne, her target in uncovering a potential assassination plot. He’s kind, charming—and might have information about what really happened to her father. Torn between duty and dizzying emotion, Tania will have to decide where her loyalties lie...or risk losing everything she’s ever wanted. Lillie Lainoff's debut novel is a fierce, whirlwind adventure about the depth of found family, the strength that goes beyond the body, and the determination it takes to fight for what you love. Includes an author's note about her personal experience with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.",
